# final2-eiggenFace

## Introduction.
The human face is an extremely complex and dynamic structure with characteristics that can quickly and significantly change with time. It is the primary focus of attention in social relationships and plays a major role in the transmission of identity and emotions. Therefore, face recognition is applied in many important areas such as security systems, identification of criminals, verification of credit cards and so on. Unfortunately, many face features make development of facial recognition systems difficult.

## Background. 
The algorithm is based on an eigenfaces approach which represents a PCA method in which a small set of significant features are used to describe the variation between face images. One of the simplest and most effective PCA approaches used in face recognition systems is the so-called eigenface approach. This approach transforms faces into a small set of essential characteristics, eigenfaces, which are the main components of the initial set of learning images (training set).
